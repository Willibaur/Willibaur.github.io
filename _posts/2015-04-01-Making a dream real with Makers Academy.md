Back in 1999 when I had my first contact with programming at Army University in
Bogota-Colombia, I was dreaming to become a Mechatronic Engineer and build all
kind of robots. It was that interaction using C++ what made me realized how
powerful IT will be in future, so I learned my first programming language; I
started to understand all that logic behind variable, functions  (methods were
not in the horizon by then) and how to code my first "hello world" program.

With the practice came the ability to use that small amount of knowledge for my
main objective, design and build autonomous mobile robots, so I translate my
skills to programming micro-controllers or Pic's as they were know back then.

I found it very useful but at the same time I though, why there is no a place
where you can actually learn how to code properly, having in mind that in the
early 90's Internet and Google was not so popular especially in countries like
Colombia, so there was no massive tutorial sites, no Codecademy or even
stackoverflow.

Years passed in a blink of an eye and 2005 arrived, God gave me a huge
opportunity to change my whole life and that is why I ended up moving
permanently to London - U.K., new culture, new country and my future wife by
then all in one.

After some time trying to find a spot on any kind of electronic role in the
capital unsuccessfully, in 2008 I managed to get a position within a PR company
as something called reader analyst, over there I got the experience required to
be part of this society and understand the way things were done on this country.

Some other years went again and as someone said "a lot of water went under the
bridge" and 2015 arrived, London Olympics, Premier League, Champions and any kind
of huge events I had the chance to see and be part of, just because in London
everything can be possible.

And one day, a bit sad at my work, I came across of this article on The Telegraph:

[*Coding boot camp*](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/technology/computer-coding/11779855/coding-courses-uk.html)

After I read that, my life change for good, that was something I was looking for
the last seven years, a place where I could learn new technologies and methodologies
needed to get my foot within the IT industry. 700.000+ jobs needed to fill the
gap in the industry and my question was "What do I need to do for getting one of
those jobs", my answer................[*Makers Academy*](www.makersacademy.com/)
