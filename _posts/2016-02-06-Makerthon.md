After all these difficult days with AngularJS, I feel so happy I could implement a complete functional solution for a ToDo list, the business logic was a bit tricky, but in an ironic way it was the magic that AngularJS has the key to solve this challenge, I have to point out that this is the first weekend exercise that is not similar to the project developed during the week, which boost my morale, heavily impacted by the hard week I had with Rails. Coaches were really pleased to see the code behind my solution, was solid, clean and readable, although I was told I should reduce the amount of feature tests for future projects, number of reasons, most important costs.

Makerthon is finally here, this is a good point within the course to evaluate how confident we are we all skills learned so far, this is an exercise which mocks more or less how real work environment is, a project that needs to be done without any prior scaffolding for us, but the final solution needs to be implemented using all best practices Makers are leaders on, things like TDD, BDD, skinny controllers, etc. The project I decided to work in was an idea proposed by my good friend Chris, is about a mobile notification with the platform number for a specific train you want to use, the team is conformed by Tony, Chris, Kirk and myself.

In the Makerthon kick off we were told that we should be use a project manager for this task, that is how things are done in real life, one good piece of software for this matter is Waffle, it seems a bit complex at first glance.

It is already Thursday, our application called Platformation is getting shape slowly, we had some problems initially using a couple of apis that used protocols which are difficult to interact with, like SOAP; after a tip from our coach Leo, we moved into a far quicker and more readable API.

On the other hand, I have been getting a lot of problems trying to implement a feature on the front-end, it is a auto-complete input box that allow the uses to select an station out of the 2500+ the U.K. has at present, the issue is that if we want to use all best practices used at Makers, you would not have many sources of information on the Web due to the fact the have been implemented recently so not many people have tested them, therefore not many blogs, stackoverflow questions etc are available.

Final day, after one and a half frustrating days I found the answer of how to translate my third party library written using $scope format to the self, thanks to an answer posted on slack and answered by Norman Fassey, and ex Maker student, so easy once you solved the problem but according to coaches, this was a good example of how well prepared we are in order to approach new challenges as developers.

We were happy we our solution, having in mind it still needs some more work in terms of refactoring and styling.
