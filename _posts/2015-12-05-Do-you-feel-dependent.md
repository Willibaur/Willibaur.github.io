  alt="Dependency Injection">

After that exhausted airport challenge weekend, there was just a few hours to recover before second arrived, Monday morning as I thought would be what I was expecting, tired faces, questions, doubts, frustrations and many other feelings mixed across my cohort. My day started very early, trying to refactor and "polish" my solution to the challenge before arriving at Makers, I was happy for one side due to the fact I managed to finish what was required and when that magic number appeared on my repo 98.643% I was satisfied, at the same time, I was feeling not comfortable at all because I got that result working in pair with my peer Tony Young, it was amazing in a way to find a solution based only in our instincts and not checking anything else on the web in a few more than five hours, but the main purpose was to do it alone; we both talked at the end that if we would be working alone the outcome would be different.

Morning stand up came, we expose our case, our coach Sam said it was no cheating at all, we honestly said what we had done and that is part of the whole learning process.

Code review on our solution, many concepts appeared on the horizon, like mixin, dependency  injection, SPR, private methods and some others I don't remember at the moment, we had implemented some of them consciously some other we did without knowing it and some others we simply did not use at all. The reviewer was happy in general, he said we had done quiet well because we were able to deliver the final working solution so we absorbed all that info and moved into refactoring the solution based on the code review and also using techniques shown by another coach Sam Morgan in a video with his approach for the solution.

I have got a good pair of partners these days, Emma, she is a very organized woman, I really liked that part, trying to follow all steps as we were told and very intuitive mind.

Tommy, a very clever young guy, he studied maths at university he was able to read User stories really fast and figure out in his mind the whole solution structure.

Tony Young and Tristan Crossley, they are the kind of partners that have what you expect from a good partner, very calmed guys, always open mind to new ideas, raising questions in the right moment and spotting those minor typo or syntax errors.

Edward Kerry, it was a very productive day with Ed, steady but firm pace we had, rewriting his code, extracting two classes, where I realized I had some errors in my previous code that by the way was passing all my tests, which reminded me that not all green tests means that your system is doing everything according to the User stories; I would say the most important part of this pairing work was the fact that we could find the right algorithm for our Oystercard system.

Friday arrived and my last partner was Jamie, a really clever person, the best part of working with him is how nice and organized his code looked, very calmed guy, his code was simple short and effective, something I really like to have in my portfolio as a developer.

I could practice my extracting class skill, we both were worried because we have not reached that bit about dependency injection and though we would need that for the challenge, at the end of the day we got through chapter of Sandy Metz POODR book and linking that with all answers raised during the week on the stand ups about that, we managed to learn how to inject a class.

A very productive week this one has been, a lot of things in my brain, now I have started to think in a very global perspective when I need to design a feature, constantly evaluating if I am going in the direction is also very useful, but the most important part is that I do not have stress at all, I am enjoying  coding, asking myself or my partner about specific issues, interacting with my peers, be able to explain abstract concepts like dependency injection or my approach when extracting a class to someone, then look their faces of gratitude because that concept is finally clear for them is an awesome feeling.
