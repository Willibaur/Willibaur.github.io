This week has brought a lot of ups and downs, Monday was ok, we had different talk sessions, knowing Makers structure, values and vision, I was really impressed with many things said then, like Transparency, this concept translated at any level internally and externally, staff salaries open to anyone who is part of Makers, we as new members of this family will be allow  to access any content produced by Makers on git forever, giving us the chance to contribute not only during the course but for the rest of our careers, it reassures me  "this was the right decision".

I have learned a lot of things through this week, many good tips for working with git, like creating and working on branches, work as a collaborator in a project but the most important thing for me was the fact that at this stage of my learning process, is more beneficial if I try to work with different code when changing my pair partner than using only mine. That process gave me new challenges every day, I observed and analyzed that there were different ways of solving the same problem.
Debugging errors on RSec came from nil to I would say 70-80%, now I’m not scared or frustrated when I got that red color in front of me, like Tansaku said “it is like a chess game” my PC is defying me to solve it and when I finally got my green color, it is like check mate.

Doubles have been a huge important improvement, I struggle with it at the beginning but the more I tried to explain it to other peers, the more I got it clear in my mind, this reaffirm my idea about I learn faster when I try to explain a concept to others even though I not a master at it, I really enjoy doing that, maybe that is why I find debugging a powerful tool.

Helping some peers to redo Boris bikes from scratch helped me to understand the difference between instance variables, setters, getters and by that how to set up and when to use attribute accessors.
User stories for me was the main issue, it took me two or three days to understand them and how I should translate them into a feature test and then into RSpec, I am still having some troubles but now I can work through them easier.
Time management after Makers, with this I meant that the first days I did not feel comfortable when I arrived at home at night and tried to work a couple of hours more, I ended up sad because I did not get improvement at all, my mind was completely exhausted by then. By the end of the week I change my whole sleeping time and everything went well since then, no more coding after leaving Makers, go to bed early 9:00 and wake up at 4:30 with my mind and body completely fresh.
When I’ll be in the situation that my pair partner has more experience than me the topic we’ll be working on, I will ask him/her in a calm way to stop before I can get everything clear in my mind, after hearing that talk about non-violent communication I realized that we can meet our needs if we express them in the right moment.
Trying to help others with particular issues and solve them as a group is a very pleasant feeling. Now, I understand coach Sam about how positive is when I ask myself at the end of every day how much did I learn today and the answer is yes I learned this or that regardless of how many steps I got that day on my challenge, this is not a race, is a learning process. So I only care about one thing now, TRUST; trust in everything, Makers as source of knowledge, trust in my cohort as support and trust in myself because if I have reached this point is because I have what is required to succeed on this 16 weeks journey.
