I have learned many things through this week, I found particularly powerful TDD, it was something I have read about it many times but when I went through fizzbuzz I understood why I used to fell so frustrated when I had a black screen on Atom, simply because I was working in the wrong way. New questions have risen, more errors I that I have had to fix, but finally I feel that my confidence is growing, is not how much commands do you remember, but how well you understand your problem specification and the way to translate that in your Rspec.

My first experience creating a website was far better that I was expecting, a lot of technologies used, but a good indicator that some of the most used elements on top sites on the world can be done without many years of experience, having introduced a Twitter and Facebook icon was something I though would require vast amount of knowledge, which leads me to my final conclusion, this is only the tip of the iceberg, this journey on Makers has just started and many greatest things will happen.

After I gained some experience with the basics on Rspec, I proved myself, why not creating my own Kata, I tend to see that more beneficial that answering ten katas; the feedback has been huge, using my experience with ruby, the challenges already done and even though Codewars does not use Rspec, once you have learn the principles of TDD you can start moving around any different environments.

Evening sessions as planned the week before took place and gave me more guidance to issues I didn't have before so I gained more knowledge.
I have an issue this week with something I believed would be the easiest part, Heroku. I made couple of errors when setting my site and then with Github, which gave me as result that I could not deploy my site properly to Heroku, but it once proved me that the way we are being taught is the right one, when you can rely on your peers within the cohort and get solutions to your problems.

I need to find better ways to express my ideas verbally, sometimes I feel I am not able to passed them just with words and end up writing code and show them graphically.
My first week at Makers HQ, an experience I have planned for months. I want to start my days over there as earlier as possible, maybe 6:30 or 7:00, I'm not sure if I could, I think that two hours working before the start of each day would be very beneficial for me.
