Another weekend challenge has gone, the course in entering into its final phase, Rails was not very easy to digest, I think is too much magic, too many things happening in the background. I tried to provide a solution for the instagram challenge, but for first time during the course, I did not implement it a fully functional solution, my solution was only able to allow users to sign in and sign up using third party authentication via facebook. It was a weird feeling, but as I talked with coach Ptolemy, these can of situations are normal during your life as developer. So conclusion is, try to catch up with all Rails issues and reinforce them next week during the Makerthon.

I have paired with all my peers different styles, I have learned many tips, techniques and ways to see not only coding but life in general. I will pair again with some of them on this new technology called AngularJS.

AngularJS is a front-end framework that allows me to have dynamic pages, is really powerful once you understand how to interact with it, for me it is like when you see a wild horse for first time and you know how good it is, the clue is getting used to it.

Another couple of days have gone, all cohort struggling with AngularJS, a lot of tutorials mentioned between us and also by coaches, by middle week coaches Leo, Stefan and Ptolemy decided to do a breakout due to level of frustration was at its most, -they had warned us at the beginning of the week that it will happen, every cohort has fallen under Angular powers-.

It is Friday, this has been the week with the slowest progress so far during the course, not only for me but for the entire group. Makers tutorial about Github Profile is not particularly long, but in my opinion it was full a too many new topics, like Karma, Protractor, Node itself, I managed to finish it, I'm a bit worried about the weekend challenge but we'll see how it goes.
