Another week has come to and end. Ruby kickstart gave a lot of new experiences, thanks to a remote pair session with Michael Lennox I learned how to set up a test environment using atom. Also, I understood how important is to test my code bit by bit, in that way I can avoid potential errors.

I had 3 more remote pair programming seasons, one of them with my tutor, from there, I noticed that I can pick up concepts faster when I work in pair or within a group than on my own.

Codewars, at the beginning it looked something I was not ready to do, but after a while, I could see all benefits I could get from it, my confidence was getting stronger,  having almost reached kyu 6 was a personal achievement.  I have learnt a lot of good practices when giving a solution to a challenge, then I visualized how beautiful and simple Ruby is, having said that, I need to admit that I have become addict to try to find solutions in only one line of code.

I have not had enough time to work through the challenges because I am still at work, trying to work at nights on it is resulting in my body to be exhausted by 11pm. I was not able to finish all challenges by Monday morning.
