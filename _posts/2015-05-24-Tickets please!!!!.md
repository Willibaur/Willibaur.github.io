  alt="Interview">

The final date arrived, after several days working on my Codecademy doing Ruby, Command Line and CSS amongst other tutorials; reading and trying to find solutions to most of the Chris Pine's challenges, I was there at Makers, waiting for Nikesh to be interviewed, I was anxious, proof of this was I arrived 40 minutes before my actual appointment.

It was my first interaction with Atom, everything looked from different world, but state of the art, as I always had seen on sci-fi movies.

I was asked by Nikesh to talk a bit about me, why I was thinking to become a Maker, was my family and I aware of how my whole life would change for the next 4 months, what did I have to succeed on this course. A few minutes passed and then the logical test started on the white-board. I failed in every attempt, by that moment I thought "I'm done I won't get in".

Coding test on Ruby change the whole panorama, I could give answer to 4 out 5 different mini challenges asked by Nikesh, every one more difficult that the previous one.

A bit more than half an hour had passed when we concluded the interview, a mixed of feelings invaded me, sad because I had not performed well in the logical test but at the same time I was comforted for my Ruby one.

Long night, next day looked endless, checking my phone every 5 mins to see if I had signal or any missed call, by late afternoon it was him, Nikesh calling me to give my the final verdict from Makers.........

"We have decided you have what is required to get through.....welcome aboard" more or less what he said.
