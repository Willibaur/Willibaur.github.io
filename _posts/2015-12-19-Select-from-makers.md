Another weekend came to an end, another weekend challenge appeared on the horizon, this time was a classic rock, paper, scissors game implementation with two variants in you were feeling really enthusiast when implementing that solution.

I started to attempt my solution on Saturday morning as usual, tried to have my initial design as clear as possible in my head, following all practices learned so far, I set up my framework and start writing my feature tests, then I reached a point where I had to divert from those test to Unit tests where my logic  will be loaded, most of the day was spent doing so. By late night I was happy with my functional logic side and for first time I got 100% in my Coveralls reports which indicated me that I had tested every single bit of my code. Sunday came and after sharing sometime with my family I started to carry on with my features and link my logic with my front end, it was good, normal errors as usual but after debugging them I found the problem, my dear friend String.

Code review took place on Monday, it was really good, done by my mentor Tom Barnes and his peer Yev from Belarus, both part of the Ronin cohort -students who take Makers Academy course remotely- the outcome was interesting, they were happy with my approach, my code was clean and readable, obviously a couple of things that needed to be refactored but a positive feedback after all, I was satisfied with my solution, even though I could not spend a lot of time on my CSS.

This week the challenge during the week will be databases, a new and interesting topic when you are a developer, my partner for today is Michael Lennox, a brilliant mind, a person whose passion for coding is awesome, his energy when coding and corporal expressions when succeeds doing an implementation are admirable, we went through the first steps of the challenge, reading and understanding the theory behind db -abreviation for database- then we wrote a blog about what we had understood, after that we played around with our first db.

In the evening I attended with some of my peers a conference called London Ruby Conference, which is taking place once a month, that night the talk was leading by Tansaku, the Head of Education at  Makers Academy, it was fun doing some Codewars, even though some of them were a bit tricky.

Getting more involved with databases by Tuesday were my new partner was Adam Lancaster, great person, having the right question for a particular doubts, something that I really like, he can read the flow of a problem very easy and fast, takes time to explain you something you don't understand, also he is very open when you asked for tips or particular tools I never have used before, I enjoyed working with him, he is always willing to help someone who needs some guide or advice for me that is one of the most important characteristics on a developer.

My partner for Wednesday was Kirk, he has a great concept about many to many and one to many, for me it is a bit difficult to understand at the moment, he said he learned those concepts in the school and it was easy back then but now in his opinion is a bit confused; for me the whole concept of databases is clear, how do I interact with it either using, sql manually or by using another tool like DataMapper, but joining tables seems to be a challenge itself now.
