alt="Start your journey">

It did not take me too much to decide that Makers was the right option for making my dream real, even though I read about General Assembly, another coding boot camp, I saw some videos and did not like the way they teach, next step open evening.

I was a bit nervous that Monday night, it was my first time interacting with some other dreamers, in general one single desire, change our lives for good.

As soon as some of the graduates started to give their testimonies,  - I just remember some of them: Rachel Nolan, Ivette Cook and Karin Nielsen- my curiosity triggered immediately, all info getting into my mind, processing and getting fast conclusions, I was on the right platform and this train would be leaving soon.

Questions session started and I did not have to make my own ones, it was like if every person on that room was thinking the same, is it worth?, are you happy?, how difficult was that? and yeah what about the salaries!!!.

And then in one corner, he was there like great master Yoda in Star Wars, @Nikesh, analyzing prospects and sensing who would have the force to get through this journey.
