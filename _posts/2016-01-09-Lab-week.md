This week is Lab Week at Makers, an opportunity to do many things, but hey we were warned we need to think carefully how to plan it wisely, otherwise you would end up trying to do a lot of things with no success by Friday.

So after considering all options presented last Friday, I decided to go for doing some Beacons stuff with my friends Richard Moss, Adam Lancaster and Tony Young, we will be the only team working with hardware.

The main idea for this project is to learn how interact with a Beacon, capture sensor signals and use them then to change behavior on our thermostat application so we potentially could send push notifications to a mobile on Android or iOS platforms.

After two and a half days playing with Beacons, Evothings, Cordova, Xcode and Android Studio, all tools needed to build applications on mobile devices I had some conclusions.

I learned how to use a benchmark called Evothings that is used to hook up applications on JavaScript to mobile devices and you can change your code and see it implemented and built straight away.

I managed to integrate my thermostat application with a device called iBeacon using my mobile with a protocol developed by Apple and introduced at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in 2013. Various vendors have since made iBeacon-compatible hardware transmitters - typically called beacons - a class of Bluetooth low energy (LE) devices that broadcast their identifier to nearby portable electronic devices. The technology enables smart phones, tablets and other devices to perform actions when in close proximity to an iBeacon.

I set up a development environment for Android and iOS platforms to develop native applications on each one, having said that, I concluded from that exercise that Android initial setup takes far more time and it is a bit more complex than iOS but once it's done, you can interact with your apps easier, Apple has too many restrictions when you want to do simple things like push notifications.

Trying to push notifications on mobile devices was not as easy as I thought,
I underestimated the amount of time needed to understand how to design and implement apps for mobile devices.

Bowling challenge demonstrated me that if you do not have a clear picture in your mind of how your solution would look like, it does not matter how much TDD you write, you would end up spending a lot time and maybe you will be stuck with no ideas, by then I had to admit my approach was not the ideal and instead of spending more time trying to fix something I started a different approach from scratch.

I had a sensation that I could have used lab week in a better way like if I should had done something else, something I could be using immediately at Makers next week, but after a chat with my friend Chris I understood that a week is not productive only if you haven not code at all on the entire week, apart from that the fact that by now I don't know MEAN or any other language does not mean my week was a failure, coding is that, practicing, reviewing pairing and the more you do, the better all concepts in your mind take form.
