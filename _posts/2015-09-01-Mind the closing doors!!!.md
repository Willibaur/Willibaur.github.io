A few months passed after I finally received my yearned green light from my doctors to re-start my journey, so here I am, a few days from the start of my  Pre-course, a lot of nights doing tutorials trying to understand different concepts, asking me "is this enough to be prepared for the course?", what would be the level from other students, maybe they would be in far better position than me. But everything starting to become more clear every single time I learned some new technology, or when was able to finish a new tutorial, but the more important indicator of improvement was when I could answer some questions within Codecademy blog an I was earning more points and badges because of that. I was ready as best as I could, considering that I had to divide my time between my family, my work and my studies. My family always supporting me and telling me "that is what you have desired all this years, you will be good at it!!", those words working in mind for determination.

Next week, I would be facing and answering all previous doubts, PreCourse start had arrived.
