Lab week has gone, now we are focused on something called by the coach as "the wild west for web developers", and in fact I can see why. Ruby on rails is so open that you can go in many different directions to get the same result, but sometimes this can lead you to leave the TDD behind, because of rails Magic!!!!.

After code review done between hour peers we hit Rails straight away, my first partner was Richard Moss, a polyglot, versatile and energetic voyager, which had the opinion than me about Rails Magic, too many things happening at the same time under Rails hood, too much info to digest in a few days, really brutal change from what we have seen so far.

My next partner was Jonathan, very sharp mind who reads code issues very well and the way he explained them to me were so crystal, even though I am getting issues trying to understand this whole concept of associations and migrations, I can not see them clear, that is why I haven't advanced too much in the challenge itself, I hears that Ptolemy, one of the coaches from MA has a repo with something called galactic Koan, which could give a big boost in my understanding about associations, so tomorrow I will try to convince my next partner to do them.

Tristan is my new partner, he is in the same position that me, trying to understand how associations works, so we agreed to give a go to Ptolemy koans during the morning.

It was a bit hard at the beginning but after having done some research and analyzing the solutions given we could start getting a clear picture about migrations and associations, so we could move back to the yelp challenge with more confidence, having said that, at this point we are not so happy the way this tutorial has been designed, is like a long manual to follow instead of the normal guides we had got so far, but apparently this is the way things are done in this industry. I was pleased to work with Tristan, he is a very relaxed partner, we could communicate easily during the whole day.

My last partner this week was James, another Spanish speaker, who lived in Argentina and another couple of South American countries when he was a child, he was pleased we could practice coding all day in Spanish, I have to admit I felt good, explaining my ideas my issues in my native language was a real good experience, something that I have not done in more than 15 years.

In conclusion these week has been really difficult for me, as I said earlier I personally think that it was too much information to digest in just 5 weeks, but I think this the Makers way, we will see how instagram challenge treats me during the weekend.
