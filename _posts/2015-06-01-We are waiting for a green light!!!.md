  Sometimes God, life, Universe or whatever you want to call it reminds you that you are not the most important things on the world but a normal human being, so one day I had to put all my plans on halt due to health issues and for my own sadness I called Makers to say I would not be attending my initial cohort proposed by July 2015, instead I would be joining the November one.

  Postponed but not canceled, meant many more weeks of training doing Codecademy tutorials getting 70+ badges and nearly 1000+ points, command line on Linux and many other related things with web developing.
