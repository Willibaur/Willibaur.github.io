Weekend challenge was a good exercise, I applied every concept I had got problems with during the week, I was a bit worried how it will be when I had to take some decisions on my solution about dependency injection, or maybe when would be the  right moment for extracting a class, or something even simple like how to use a double in a proper way.

It took me all Saturday but finally I produced a solution completely from scratch and no using previous example on the web as scaffolding, I tried to apply a clean, concise and elegant style when coding through the process.

The best part of this challenge was the fact of using something totally new for me, a gem called Twilio, which allows me to send text messages by implementing a class within my system, awesome experience when I sent my first text, having said that I made an error when I pushed my code with my Twilio credentials and private data on it, after looking a post from Gimmi, one of my peers, I understood that I would need to install another gem called dotenv which allows me to use my app in my machine but not pushing sensitive info to github.

I was really pleased when one of the coaches was allocated to check my code, Ptlomey made good comments on my code like it was a clean a precise code, my use of dependency injection was driven in the right way, my README was the one expected on a system, I missed the part  where I indicate the user how to run tests for my system.

Overall I was happy with my solution, needs to be refactored a bit but I proved myself all my knowledge is getting shape now.

We are ready for the battle project, this week challenge, my partner for Monday is Giamir, italian guy who studied IT engineering in Italy, has experience in many topics will touch during the course, really methodic person, he likes the idea of a clean code and best use of practices, I liked the way he had his terminal environment, he explained me a lot about hml and protocols, we moved fast through the challenge which was good but I had to review some concepts on my own at night.

By Tuesday I got Andrew as a partner, he was a very point of reference for me, not rushing through the tutorials, not getting everything as truth because it was written, we tested every single detail we thought it was relevant to check, debugging, making small changes and analyzing how did it impact the output, etc. I really like to continue my learning process in that way Andrew taught me for sure.

Colin was my next partner, I had been talking with him on different occasions about the whole course, life in general but this was the first time we share a coding space all day, he is a very good partner, instead of breaks we had small chats, jokes and questions about life in general, but the most important part of the day for me -this is what amaze me about Makers- was when he shared something that has changed his whole life since he started this journey as a developer, by using meditation sessions and tips given by our great coach Dana, he has changed his way of dealing with frustrations, angers and depressions, thanks to that he can now see all those things as simple situations that always have a solution at the end of the day, those situations cannot affect your life in any way. Again, something powerful about Makers is not only about code, is about how the human being can establish a strong link with the code and how this connection can derive in a better lifestyle.

I was working the next day with Katie Smith, a very talented woman, intuitive, she knows how to navigate through a stack trace error, morning session was a bit slow, I was a bit behind her on the project, we were a bit stacked on deciding which parts of one class should be extracted, plus one problem related with github, so I thought we would not finish everything by the end of the day.

We were invited to see the presentation from the senior cohort on something called Makerthon, it was a real demonstration of very professional developers, sites working automated stats in it, using the most recent technologies, developers learning totally new languages in a couple of days and the presentation itself was so clean, I felt like if I was in one of those big conferences I had seen no youtube.

Back to work, something rare happened to Katie and me, in less than 3 hours we managed to finish all the project and even had time to try to style our site by introducing CSS, we were really happy with what we produced in that time, another example of what we were told weeks ago, if you enjoy coding, it will come out naturally from your mind, what a great partner Katie is.

My last partner for this week was Hamid, I have got several talks with him in the past weeks about coding and life in general, back into the challenge we went back a few steps, but thanks to him I understood some concepts that were a bit unclear in my mind, I think he had some clarifications as well, he works really hard every single day, always having a big smile on his face even if we were not able to find a solution to an specific problem.

Another has gone, everything was so fast, I would like to be able to be at Makers more than 3 months, this is the best learning environment I have never been in, and I really love it. Thanks Makers.
