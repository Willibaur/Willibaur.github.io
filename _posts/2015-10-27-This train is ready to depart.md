One week has passed on my pre-Course, so far I have got the opportunity of reading what has been assigned, installed all environment workspace without major issues, I think after all, having worked with Linux all this time has been very useful, I am already familiar with commando line, even though I quite don't understand how command 'grep' works, I think is just the fact that I haven't used too much at the moment.

I had done some short tutorials about Git in the past, I think is very similar to Maven, which I used a few years ago when I was learning about object oriented programming at City University; I think Git is particularly easier to work with, you do not need to be even a developer to use it on a daily basis, over the Internet I have found teachers from primary schools, writers and many other professions where it can be a powerful tool.

And Friday has arrived, with it our first weekend challenge, command line obviously and Octocat. I got through that not as quicker as I thought, especially after finding that I have not read all guides provided, my first of many mistakes, I though Makers was asking me something different that we had done during the week because of that.

Slack has proved to be a very useful tool for me, keeping in mind that I am one of those strange human beings not using any social network until now, so I had to read a bit about how to use it in general.

Well, one week less and sixteen more will come, on track at the moment though.
