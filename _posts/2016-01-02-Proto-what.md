After an excellent Christmas party and 2 weeks break at Makers, some conclusions came to my mind, Codewars became a kind of a daily necessity for me, in a positive way, I found my experience with Ruby has become stronger, the more katas I practice the better I understand the concept of best practices, clean code etc; one per day is enough to not lose your grips on Ruby -which in my personal opinion is the most elegant, simple and readable programming language-.

After playing around with my bookmark manager for a few days I got clear in my mind the whole concept of sessions, validations and how to interact with a db using DataMapper, having said that I started the implementation of my solution for the next challenge Chitter, it was far easier than bookmark but still had some tricky bits reserved for keeping me busy, I managed to solve all requirements and everything looked so beautiful in Rspec with that bright green color, then I decided to refactor some bits of my code and fall into one of the main rules as a developer, not stopping and rest instead of messing with the whole code, as a result of that I ended up with an app partially functional; lesson learned though.

Time to come back after the break, glad to come back to Makers, which now is like my second home, I feel weird when I am not there regularly though.

Code review was done, my mentor Tom Barnes was really happy the way I presented my solution, the code was clean and readable, test written and presented in an organized way, so conclusion: best practices start to be part of my life as a developer.

Topic for this week is JavaScript, something I have done in the past in a very brief way thanks to Codecademy, now since the optic of TDD.

My first partner this week was Sara Tateno, a great woman with a brilliant mind, we tried to understand the differences between Javascript and Ruby, which by the way I already missed, how elegant and clear it is; anyway Jasmine test environment appeared in the horizon, some similar things with Rspec and there you go, try to solve FizzBuzz with this whole new environment, couple of errors due to we were not used to the new syntax, but we felt comfortable working on that. Good day after Christmas break.

Next day I was paired with Gimmi, in my opinion he is the kind of person who was born to be a developer, I really enjoy the way he mixes theory and practice when coding, how simple some complex tasks can be solved, his energy, patient and always open to any comment or different point of view to give a solution. We carried on finishing fizzbuzz and then by midday my friend Hamid joined us to attack the airport challenge, I was curious about the experience of working in a group of 3, but the whole exercise was really good, all of us drove the code at certain point, we played around with github and solved all issues we encountered during the process.

My next partner would be Gareth, but he had been sick off due to a bug he got in a hospital when visiting a relative of him, so it meant that I would have my first solo coding day at Makers, it was a nice experience, guiding by my instincts, errors as normal would take a bit more of the time to be solved than when having a partner, but it was all a positive experience.

By Thursday I had a really unpleasant experience in my journey to Makers, it was a rainy early morning and because of that all floor at DLR station was slippery so I ended up falling and having an small accident at the stairs, I managed to stand up and decided to carry on instead of going to Hospital, another proof that coding and Makers are so important in my life that sometimes put myself aside. Anyway I spent my whole morning session with Charlie my new partner, a charismatic guy who is always making you laugh. After a while, my body reminded that I needed to be checked by a doctor so my painful body led me to Hospital to confirm that no bone was broken because my accident, I had to rest all that afternoon by result of that.

Friday came with a good news, next week will be Lab week, something I had been waiting for; it's the opportunity to work basically on your own, either doing consolidation, learning new languages, clearing your github, or do whatever you like to. I personally like the idea of doing something with hardware but is seems that topic is no so much popular within my peers, so I will have to figure out what it will by Sunday. Bowling challenge is there as well, looks not so difficult though but you never know.
