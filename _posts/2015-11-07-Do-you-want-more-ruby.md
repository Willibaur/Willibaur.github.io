The most important lesson for me this week is that I should have quitted my job before the beginning of the PreCourse, it is very intense (which by the way I found really awesome), because of that you should focus all your energy and attention on it.

Doing evening pair programming sessions gave me a lot answers and opened the door to many new questions as well, that process is helping me to find answers in a better and practical way.

I have come to a conclusion, is not about to know where the answer is, but about asking myself "Am I doing the right question?".

Setting a plan for doing different activities like, reading theory about programming, Codewars and pair sessions is very important on this journey, every day I understand why that 20 mins rule is so vital.

I felt I did not have enough time to spend reading and coding while working or at nights, even when I pushed myself really hard I could feel that my mind and body were totally tired, is not an excuse I should have planned this beforehand but that gave me the pressure to carry on in order to finish my challenges.

On the other hand, I have a good experience at the end of the week, when I received a message from Ed Kerry on Slack, stating that he had progressed a lot that week due to I had cleared some his doubts the weekend before when we met at Ace hotel. Something positive that tells me that all theory I have been practiced in isolated ways is connecting now for producing concrete ideas.

Three weeks have gone so far on this PreCourse, Ruby kicstart has been really challenging not only on the technical side but on my mind, testing my patience and confidence, which I should confess sometimes was really low.
