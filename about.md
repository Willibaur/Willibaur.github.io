Hi, for some reason you have reached this page, I thank you for that.

I am **William Bautista-Romero**, until recently a Mechatronic Engineer, since
2015 a dreamer trying to become a Full Stack Web Developer, this is my business
card to the world.

I will always be grateful with God, my family and Makers Academy of course, all of them have played an important role in my life to get that dream real.
